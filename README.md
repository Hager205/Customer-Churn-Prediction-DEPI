## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements advanced machine learning techniques to predict customer churn behavior. By analyzing patterns in customer data, businesses can identify at-risk customers and take proactive steps to improve retention.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline
- Statistical feature analysis using T-Tests, and Chi-Squared Tests
- Advanced feature engineering to capture customer engagement patterns
- Multiple ML models comparison: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression
- Detailed performance evaluation with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC metrics
- MLOps implementation for model deployment and monitoring
- Dual deployment: Streamlit (interactive UI) and FastAPI (API + web interface)
- Containerized deployment with Docker for FastAPI
- Logging for both API and Streamlit apps for monitoring and debugging

## 📊 Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Outlier detection and treatment using IQR and Box-Cox transformations
- Feature transformation and encoding for categorical variables
- Normalization and scaling of numerical features

### Milestone 2: Advanced Analysis & Feature Engineering
- Statistical analysis using T-Tests, and Chi-Squared Tests
- Feature selection through Random Forest importance and statistical significance
- Creation of derived features (engagement score, interaction frequency, etc.)
- Dimensionality reduction techniques to manage feature space

### Milestone 3: Model Development & Evaluation
- Implementation of multiple algorithms:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV
- Comprehensive performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and AUC
- Model comparison to select the champion model

### Milestone 4: MLOps & Deployment
- Developed a user-friendly web application using **Streamlit** for real-time customer churn prediction.
- Developed a robust **FastAPI** app for both API and web-based JSON input.
- **Containerized the FastAPI app using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.**
- Integrated the preprocessing pipeline into both apps to ensure consistency with the training process.
- Saved and loaded the trained scaler and model using **pickle** for seamless deployment (see `model/` directory).
- Designed interactive interfaces for users to input customer data and view predictions.
- Added logging to both apps for monitoring and debugging (`streamlit_app.log`, `fastapi_app.log`).
- Modular and scalable code structure for future cloud deployment.

## 📈 Results

Our model comparison revealed that **XGBoost with Important Features** achieved the best performance:

- **Accuracy**: 95.09%
- **Precision**: 95.19%
- **Recall**: 94.94%
- **F1 Score**: 95.04%
- **AUC**: 98.50%

This outperformed both Random Forest and Logistic Regression across all key metrics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scipy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- **Statistical Analysis**: T-Tests, Chi-Squared Tests
